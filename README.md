RETAIL PRICE OPTIMIZATION

This project aims to develop a Python-based AI solution for optimizing retail pricing strategies. The goal is to maximize sales while ensuring profitability by analyzing various factors such as cost of goods sold (COGS), market demand, competition, and desired profit margins.

DATASETS The dataset (retail_price.csv) is expected to contain user features, including both numerical and categorical data.
